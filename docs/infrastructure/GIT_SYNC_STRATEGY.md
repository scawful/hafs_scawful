# Git Sync Strategy (Template)

This is a generic placeholder for cross-machine git sync practices. Keep
host-specific commands and hostnames in your plugin repo (for example:
`~/Code/hafs_scawful/docs/GIT_SYNC_STRATEGY.md`).

Use `~/Code/hafs_scawful/scripts/publish_plugin_configs.sh` to sync those
host-specific docs to halext-server and the Windows GPU host.
