# Agent Instructions (hafs_scawful)

This repo contains user-specific training workflows, domain generators, and infrastructure docs.

- Keep project-specific scripts, datasets, and Windows/GPU workflows here.
- Use env vars (e.g., `HAFS_ROOT`, `HAFS_WINDOWS_USER`) for paths/hosts instead of hardcoding when possible.
- If the change is generic or affects shared runtime behavior, update `~/Code/hafs` instead.
